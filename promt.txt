Create a high-conversion landing page for a no-code QA SaaS platform called "SaaS Tester," targeting non-technical SaaS founders. The page should follow a Hormozi-style offer with a bold, results-driven tone to drive waitlist signups. Use React with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design, and include a Vercel-compatible structure for easy deployment. The landing page should include:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Headline: "Launch Your SaaS Without Losing Customers to Bugs - No Coding Required!"
   - Subheadline: "Stop Bleeding Users to Broken Signups, Logins, and Payments. Get Crystal-Clear Pass/Fail Test Reports in Minutes with Our No-Code QA Tool – Built for Non-Technical Founders."
   - Call-to-Action (CTA): A prominent button labeled "Join the Waitlist" that opens a form.
   - Visual: 
   
   - Styling: Bold typography (e.g., Inter font, 48px headline, 24px subheadline), vibrant colors (e.g., blue-600 for CTA), and a clean layout.

2. **Problem Section**:
   - Text: "Tired of buggy launches costing you users? Manual QA is slow, expensive, and error-prone. Hiring devs or using complex tools eats your budget. SaaS Tester automates end-to-end testing for signups, logins, payments, and more – no coding skills needed."
   - Styling: Centered text with a gray-100 background, 20px font for readability.

3. **Solution Section**:
   - List key benefits:
     - "No-Code Interface: Drag-and-drop tests for UI, APIs, and integrations (e.g., Stripe, HubSpot)."
     - "AI-Powered Automation: Catches bugs and edge cases, reducing QA time by 80%."
     - "Affordable: Starts at $19/month – cheaper than one lost customer."
     - "Built for No-Code Founders: Works with Bubble, Webflow, Adalo."
   - Styling: Use a grid layout with icons (e.g., checkmarks) next to each benefit, white background, blue-500 accents.

4. **Offer Section**:
   - Text: "Join the Waitlist Now for: Priority Beta Access (Q4 2025), 50% Off Your First Year, Free No-Code QA Guide, and a Zero-Risk Guarantee (full refund if we don’t catch critical bugs). Limited spots – don’t miss out!"
   - CTA: Second "Join the Waitlist" button.
   - Styling: Bold red-600 background for urgency, white text, centered layout.

5. **Sign-Up Form**:
   - Fields: Email, "What SaaS are you building?" (textarea).
   - Submit Button: "Get Early Access" (blue-600, hover: blue-700).
   - Functionality: Store form submissions in a Firebase Firestore database (include basic setup code).
   - Styling: Clean form with rounded inputs, max-width 600px, centered.

6. **Footer**:
   - Text: "SaaS Tester – Empowering Non-Technical Founders to Launch Bug-Free. Contact us on X @SaaSTester."
   - Styling: Simple black background, white text, 16px font.

Additional Requirements:
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring mobile responsiveness (e.g., flex-col on mobile, grid on desktop).
- Include basic SEO meta tags (title: "SaaS Tester - No-Code QA for SaaS Founders", description: "Launch your SaaS bug-free with no-code testing. Join the waitlist for early access!").
- Generate a `package.json` for React, Tailwind, and Firebase dependencies.
- Include a README with instructions for deploying to Vercel.
- Optimize for performance (e.g., lazy-load the mockup image placeholder).
- Add comments in the code for clarity, explaining key components.

Output the full project structure with:
- `src/App.jsx`: Main React component with all sections.
- `src/index.css`: Tailwind CSS setup.
- `src/firebase.js`: Firebase Firestore initialization for form submissions.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: Deployment instructions.

Ensure the code is production-ready, follows best practices, and is easy for a solo founder to tweak using vibe coding tools like Cursor.
